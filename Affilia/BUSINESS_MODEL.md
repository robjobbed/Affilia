# Affilia Business Model & Pricing

## 💰 Platform Fee Structure

**Affilia takes a 5% cut of every transaction.**

### How It Works

For a **$50,000 contract**:
- **Contract Value**: $50,000
- **Platform Fee (5%)**: $2,500
- **Freelancer Receives**: $47,500

### Who Pays the Platform Fee?

The platform fee is handled differently based on the payment structure:

#### 1. **Upfront Payment** (Freelancer Pays Fee)
- Hirer pays: **$50,000**
- Platform keeps: **$2,500** (5%)
- Freelancer receives: **$47,500** (95%)
- ✅ Best for freelancers (get paid immediately)

#### 2. **Milestone Payments** (Freelancer Pays Fee)
- Hirer pays: **$50,000** (split across milestones)
- Platform keeps: **$2,500** (5%, collected across milestones)
- Freelancer receives: **$47,500** (95%, distributed across milestones)
- ✅ Balanced risk for both parties

#### 3. **Pay After Completion** (Hirer Pays Fee) ⚠️
- Contract value: **$50,000**
- Freelancer cost: **$50,000** (covered by platform until paid)
- Platform fee: **$2,500** (5%)
- **Hirer pays**: **$52,500** (contract + fee)
- Freelancer receives: **$50,000** (100% of contract value)
- ✅ Best for hirers (pay only after delivery)
- ⚠️ Hirer covers the platform's cost of fronting payment

## 📊 Payment Structure Options

### Option 1: Pay 100% Upfront
```
Timeline:    Contract Signed → Immediate Payment → Work Begins → Delivery
Hirer pays:  $50,000 (day 1)
Risk:        Hirer assumes all risk
Best for:    Established freelancers, smaller projects
```

### Option 2: Pay in Milestones
```
Example: 50/50 Split
Milestone 1: $25,000 (upfront)
Milestone 2: $25,000 (on completion)

Timeline:    Contract → Pay 50% → Midpoint Delivery → Pay 50% → Final Delivery
Hirer pays:  $50,000 total (split across milestones)
Risk:        Shared between both parties
Best for:    Most projects, balanced approach
```

Common milestone structures:
- **2 Milestones**: 50% / 50%
- **3 Milestones**: 33% / 34% / 33%
- **4 Milestones**: 25% / 25% / 25% / 25%
- **Custom**: Flexible percentages (must total 100%)

### Option 3: Pay After Completion
```
Timeline:    Contract Signed → Work Begins → Delivery → Payment
Hirer pays:  $52,500 (after delivery)
            = $50,000 contract + $2,500 platform fee
Risk:        Freelancer assumes all risk
Best for:    Trusted hirers, risk-averse companies
```

**Why the extra 5%?**
When you pay after completion, Affilia fronts the entire payment to the freelancer. You're paying the platform fee to compensate for this financial risk and service.

$5,000 contract = $250 platform revenue
```

### Monthly Goals (Example)
```
100 contracts/month avg $25,000 = $2.5M total value
Platform revenue: $125,000/month (5% of $2.5M)
Annual revenue: $1.5M
```

### Growth Targets
```
Year 1: 1,000 contracts = $25M GMV = $1.25M revenue
Year 2: 5,000 contracts = $125M GMV = $6.25M revenue
