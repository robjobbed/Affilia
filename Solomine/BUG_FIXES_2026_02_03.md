# Bug Fixes Applied

## Fixed Issues

### 1. ✅ Invalid Redeclaration of 'FlowLayout'

**Problem**: `FlowLayout` struct was declared in multiple files:
- `ViewsEditProfileView.swift` (line 345)
- `ViewsFreelancerDetailView.swift` (line 312)

**Solution**: 
- Created a shared `UtilitiesFlowLayout.swift` file with a single `FlowLayout` implementation
- Removed duplicate declarations from both view files
- The layout is now accessible throughout the project without conflicts

**Files Changed**:
- ✨ Created: `UtilitiesFlowLayout.swift` - Centralized FlowLayout implementation
- 🔧 Modified: `ViewsEditProfileView.swift` - Removed duplicate FlowLayout
- 🔧 Modified: `ViewsFreelancerDetailView.swift` - Removed duplicate FlowLayout

### 2. ✅ Main Actor-Isolated Conformance Warning (Swift 6)

**Problem**: 
```
warning: Main actor-isolated conformance of 'XAuthResponse' to 'Decodable' 
cannot be used in nonisolated context; this is an error in the Swift 6 language mode
```

This occurred at line 177 in `AuthenticationManager.swift` where `XAuthResponse` was being decoded in a URLSession callback (background thread).

**Solution**: 
Added `Sendable` conformance to all social profile models:
- `XProfile: Codable, Sendable`
- `XAuthResponse: Codable, Sendable`
- `GitHubProfile: Codable, Sendable`

The `Sendable` protocol tells Swift 6 that these types are safe to pass between concurrency domains (like from background URLSession callbacks to the main actor).

**Why This Works**:
- All properties in these structs are value types (String, Int, Bool, Optional)
- Value types are inherently safe to send across concurrency boundaries
- `Sendable` conformance is automatic for structs with only Sendable properties, but making it explicit satisfies Swift 6's strict concurrency checking

**Files Changed**:
- 🔧 Modified: `AuthenticationManager.swift` - Added `Sendable` conformance to profile models

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Build the project - both errors should be resolved
- [ ] Test X authentication flow
- [ ] Verify FlowLayout displays correctly in EditProfileView
- [ ] Verify FlowLayout displays correctly in FreelancerDetailView
- [ ] No runtime issues with Sendable conformance

---

## Additional Notes

**Swift 6 Concurrency**: The `Sendable` conformance is part of Swift's data-race safety system. It ensures that data passed between different concurrency contexts (actors, tasks, etc.) is safe from data races.

**FlowLayout Reusability**: The centralized `FlowLayout` can now be used in any view throughout the app without redeclaration.
